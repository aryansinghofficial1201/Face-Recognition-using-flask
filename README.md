# 🧠 Face Recognition using Flask

A **web-based Face Recognition attendance system** built with **Python and Flask**.  
This project detects faces using a webcam or uploaded images and marks attendance based on recognized users.

> Face recognition runs through computer vision libraries such as **OpenCV** and possibly the `face_recognition` library (or Haar cascades), and the Flask framework is used to host the web interface and backend server.

## 📌 Project Overview

This application allows users to perform **face detection and recognition** through a web interface.  
The Flask backend handles camera capture/processing, and recognizes faces against stored images, marking attendance upon successful detection.

The project includes:
- A Flask server (`app.py`)
- HTML templates for UI
- Static assets (CSS, images)
- Haarcascade classifier for face detection

The app can be used for:
- Attendance marking
- User identification
- Facial login simulation

*(The exact behavior depends on implementation in your `app.py` and template code.)* :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
